    ## How to Install

        go get -d -u gobot.io/x/gobot/...


    ## How to Use

    Connect to the drone's Wi-Fi network from your computer. It will be named something like "TELLO-XXXXXX".

    Once you are connected you can run the Gobot code on your computer to control the drone.

    Here is a sample of how you initialize and use the driver:

        :::go
        package main
        
        import (
        	"fmt"
            "time"
        
        	"gobot.io/x/gobot"
        	"gobot.io/x/gobot/platforms/dji/tello"
        )
        
        func main() {
        	drone := tello.NewDriver("8888")
        
        	work := func() {
        		drone.TakeOff()
        
        		gobot.After(5*time.Second, func() {
        			drone.Land()
        		})
        	}
        
        	robot := gobot.NewRobot("tello",
        		[]gobot.Connection{},
        		[]gobot.Device{drone},
        		work,
        	)
        
        	robot.Start()
        }
